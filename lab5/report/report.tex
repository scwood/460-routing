\section{Routing Algorithm Details}
  Our routing algorithm is based on the distance-vector routing algorithm which
  uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm used to find the shortest path from each node
  to all of the other nodes within a graph. Our implementation relies on nodes
  broadcasting their distance-vector to each of their neighbors, defined to be
  one hop away. Upon receiving a broadcasted distane-vector packet the node will
  compare its distance vector to the one it received and update any costs, and
  forwarding entries accordingly.

  \subsection{Experiment Description}
    The following experiment utilizes our routing algorithm to determine routes
    between the nodes in the network displayed above. We then send a packet
    from node 1 to node 5 and trace the path it takes. The path taken should be
    in sequence from node 1 to node 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

  \subsection{Analysis}
    In conclusion the distance-vector routing algorithm is simple to implement and performs a good job at managing failures amongst nodes.
    The main drawback to this approach is the time it takes for the nodes' distance vectors to converge on the best routes to take.
